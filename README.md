A blog designed to capture and portray all the amazing things the world has to offer. A blog to help me learn to deeply absorb and appreciate all the things that nobody could hope to squeeze into a single lifetime, in body.

The internet is a wonderful place that allows anyone to experience anything; it's just difficult to grasp the gravity of digital things – difficult but, with practice, I have to believe possible.

CONCEPT

To ‘do’ something different and interesting and briefly, but completely, write about the experience. To write in a way that clearly identifies the senses at play and the emotions evoked, and more. Furthermore, the writing itself should be from the position of actually being there in body as-well-as spirit, such that anyone happening upon the blog without first reading this README, would believe that the writer was physically in attendance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAVEATS – holes which break the concept, but are aside from the point.

1. I appreciate that a blog is best accompanied by images – which due to the nature of the blog, would not be first hand images. It would be relatively easy for someone to work out that a write-up was based on something seen online, given that the images will be from the original sources (or at least, from some other third party source depicting similar substance).

2. That it will be clearly obvious to many that these experiences cannot be real; who in the world is able to walk on the moon one day, and deep sea dive the next – and further yet, who would have time to write about it if they did?
